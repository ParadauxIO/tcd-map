		This map is a work in progress. This is the prelive version of the map<br>
		I will accept help in any form. If you can use microsoft paint you can help with this project <br>
		If you can use Adobe Illustrator that'd be absolutely ideal <br>
		https://github.com/dangoreilly/tcd-map
		<br><br>

		Progress: <br>
		Arts - Fully mapped and linked <br>
		Hamilton - Ground floor and basement mapped, upper floors partially mapped. No linking yet.  <br>
		SNIAM - TBD <br>
		Lloyd - TBD <br>
		Parsons - TBD  <br> <br>

		Click/tap on the building to enter it and then click on stairs or lifts to move up and down. <br>
		Off colour buildings are being worked on, the rest will hopefully be worked on in due time. <br>
